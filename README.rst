Orolo, yet another clock menulet
================================

Idea: does not show you anything until there is something in your iCal nearby.
Then it shows the event and slowly changes color to red.

Release history
---------------

Future
~~~~~~

- Click on event to go to iCal
- A way to specifically mark events (like, process only start date etc). Notes maybe?
- Menulet can be moved around the menubar, like others (with Cmd key pressed). - seems to be impossible
- Set the interval between timer updates in Preferences (governs the smoothness of color change)
- Show date/weekday near the clock
- Make text in status bar more aesthetical
- Use sliders for intervals in Preferences?

0.0.2
~~~~~

+ Removed all hardcoding (including hardcoding of the version)
+ Added localization (at least remove string hardcoding)

- Hotkey for "Show time till closest event"
- Add "always real time mode" for cases when one needs to turn off the oven in 20 minutes or something
- Set global hotkey for Show Real Time in Preferences

Before release:
- Remove --tags key from version generator
- Check if no-restart menulet works in Lion

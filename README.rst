Orolo, yet another clock menulet
================================

Idea: does not show you anything until there is something in your iCal nearby.
Then it shows the event and slowly changes color to red.

Release history

Future
~~~~~~

- Click on event to go to iCal
- A way to specifically mark events (like, process only start date etc). Notes maybe?
- Menulet can be moved around the menubar, like others (with Cmd key pressed). - seems to be impossible
- Set the interval between timer updates in Preferences (governs the smoothness of color change)
- Show date/weekday near the clock
- Make text in status bar more aesthetical
- Use sliders for intervals in Preferences?

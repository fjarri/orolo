Orolo, yet another clock menulet
================================

Idea: does not show you anything until there is something in your iCal nearby.
Then it shows the event and slowly changes color to red.

Future
~~~~~~

- Click on event to go to iCal
- Set global hotkey for Show Real Time in Preferences
- A way to specifically mark events (like, process only start date etc). Notes maybe?
- Add localization (at least remove string hardcoding)
- Menulet can be moved around the menubar, like others (with Cmd key pressed). - seems to be impossible
- Set the interval between timer updates in Preferences (governs the smoothness of color change)
- Add "always real time mode" for cases when one needs to turn off the oven in 20 minutes or something
- Add 12/24 and AM-PM/not switch, to mimic usual clock (or take these from System Preferences)
- Add showing date too
- Remove all hardcoding
- Make text in status bar more aesthetical
- Hotkey for "Show time till closest event"
- Use sliders for intervals in Preferences?
